            The world was changing, and they knew it. Or at least, that's what we like to say about them, as people who have the gift of hindsight. 
            The early 20th century was one of the most dynamic times to be alive in human history. Between 1900 and 1950 there'd be a global pandemic
            , two world wars, two nuclear bombings, and the literal Great Depression. And this is to say absolutely nothing of the emerging miracles of 
            science, techonolgy, and other such happenings of the period. It's part of what makes studying the writings from this time so fascinating. 
            As the lives of the people who wrote during this time were almost as interesting as the works that they produced.
            For the sake of keeping this rabbit hole under control, I want to focus on three individuals, who could be said to have written, and to 
            a certain extent saw it from three different points of view.

                Whether you consider him a soldier, or just an enthusiast. Ernest Hemingway, the renowned author, was deeply influenced 
                by his experiences in war, notably World War I and the Spanish Civil War. His writing often reflects the brutality, 
                camaraderie, and existential angst found in conflict. Through terse prose and stark realism, he captured the raw essence of war, 
                portraying its impact on individuals and society. Hemingway's works like "A Farewell to Arms" and "For Whom the Bell Tolls" 
                resonate with themes of courage, love, and disillusionment amidst the chaos of battle, immortalizing the human 
                struggle against the backdrop of war.

            James Joyce, a pioneering figure of modernist literature, explored the complexities of modern life through his groundbreaking works. 
            His writing, notably in "Ulysses" and "Dubliners," delves into the minutiae of daily existence, revealing the inner thoughts and 
            struggles of ordinary individuals. Joyce's stream-of-consciousness narrative technique mirrors the fragmented nature of modern 
            consciousness, capturing the chaos and uncertainty of the modern world. Themes of alienation, identity, and the search for meaning 
            pervade his works, reflecting the disconnection and disillusionment of the modern era. Through vivid imagery and intricate symbolism, 
            Joyce unveils the beauty and banality of everyday life, offering profound insights into the human condition amidst the tumult of the modern age.

                F. Scott Fitzgerald, emblematic of the Jazz Age, grappled with the seductive allure of luxury and excess throughout his life. 
                Despite achieving fame and wealth through his literary success, Fitzgerald's extravagant lifestyle and relentless pursuit of the high 
                life led to financial woes, strained relationships, and ultimately, his downfall. He found himself ensnared in a cycle of indulgence 
                and self-destruction, mirroring the characters in his novels who navigate the gilded fa√ßade of society. Fitzgerald's struggle with 
                alcoholism further exacerbated his troubles, contributing to his decline in health. In the end, the very excesses he chronicled in 
                his writing proved to be his undoing, culminating in his premature death at the age of 44. His life serves as a cautionary tale about 
                the perils of succumbing to the temptations of luxury and excess, reminding us of the fragility of human 
                existence amidst the trappings of wealth and fame.
